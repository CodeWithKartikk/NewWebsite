<h1 style="color:#FF4500">Most necessary thing is to verify</h1>
<p>Before you buy any spare parts, the genuineness of the part, whether it is in proper working condition or not or the part meets your requirements.</p>
<p>The best way to differentiate between genuine and fake parts is to cross-reference with the OEM website. If you see the part that you are looking for on an OEM's website, then you can be sure that it's genuine.</p>
<p>You could also go through the guiding manual to check for its genuineness. Always remember to check product details (like part number), description, compatibility information, etc as these aspects are difficult to overestimate in spare parts purchase.</p>
<p>Also beware, if there is a heavy discount on a product; there are chances that the product is fake. Because most of the times it is just a vendor trying to get rid of the existing stock. </p>

      <p>Another thing to keep in mind while purchasing a spare-part is to check whether the parts come with Guarantee/ <br>
        Warranty period or not, since it allows you to return or demand renewal if the product is within the promised <br>
        period. It also works as insurance and also guarantees genuineness of the item.</p>
      <p>Never buy anything that comes without warranty because in case of product failure, you won’t be able to <br>
        return it and then you’ll have to buy a new one. So, to avoid such situation it’s better to purchase <br>
        guaranteed/warranted product only.</p></td>

      If you’re buying a spare part online, don’t forget to go through the website’s return policy from which you are purchasing the spare parts.
      <h2>Check for tracking option</h2>
      This is especially for online buyers of auto parts. In dealing with online sellers, you need to keep in mind the distance between vendor’s warehouse and your home. </td>

<p>Regardless of which online store you are buying your auto part from, be sure to check about shipping procedure and the overall cost of having your purchased product sent to you. It is important to have some type of tracking system so that you always know where your newly purchased parts are at any given time.</p>
